# ML Model Deployment on AWS Lambda: Observing Scalability
Deployed a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model on AWS Lambda using PyTorch for object detection in images. A load-testing script was used to observe Lambdaâ€™s automatic scaling behavior under concurrent executions, demonstrating its ability to handle deep learning inference efficiently in a serverless environment.
